# Gatsby Advanced Starter

A blog starter skeleton with advanced features for [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/).

## Why?

This project aims to provide a minimal for building GatsbyJS powered blogs.

It doesn't define any UI limitations in any way, and only gives you the basic components for SEO/Social Media/etc.

You are free to use any UI framework/styling options available to you.

NOTE: This project is a stripped down version of [Gatsby Material Starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter), but will evolve separately.

## How can I use this?

If you are a newcomer to Gatsby who's interested in the implementations of most needed features, this is a great place to start.

If you are interested in a foundation for building ultra-fast websites, you can use this project as a "minimal" starter.

## Getting Started

```sh
gatsby new YourProjectName https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter
npm run develop # or gatsby develop
```

Or you can fork the project, make your changes there and merge new features when needed.

Alternatively:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter YourProjectName # Clone the project
cd YourProjectname
rm -rf .git # So you can have your own changes stored in VCS.
npm install # or yarn install
npm run develop # or gatsby develop
```
