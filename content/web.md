From brand new companies to established brands, we can help you reach more customers online and expand your business. We also work with customers needing custom solutions, from creating an initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to web and native apps.

Mike has been web consulting for over a decade now, having first started with What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) Editors and Content Management Systems (CMS) back in the early 2000s. Wanting to move beyond HTML and CSS knowledge, Mike attended the coding boot camp, Hack Reactor, in 2017 to specialize in JavaScript and enter the field of Software Engineering. He has since worked as a professional software developer in the Health Care and Fintech space. xo9 leverages Mike's technical coding skills with a financial background from a B.S. in Managerial Economics from the University of California, Davis."
